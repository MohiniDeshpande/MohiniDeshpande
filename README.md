## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Bank Churn Prediction**: Developed a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave the bank using various classification algorithms. Achieved an accuracy score of 94.31%.

2. **Steel Defect Detection Using Deep Learning**: Developed an end-to-end solution for detecting defects in steel surfaces using a ResNet152V2 model for image classification and bounding box prediction.  The model was fine-tuned using pre-trained weights on ImageNet and achieved high accuracy of 97.3%.
